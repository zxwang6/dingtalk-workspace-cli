// flagTypeChange identifies one flag type migration exactly: which command,
// which flag, and in which direction. Nothing is matched by wildcard — an entry
// that differs in any of the four fields does not apply.
//
// CommandPath is the canonical Command.Path form, which always includes the root
// command name ("dws minutes permission apply"). It is deliberately *not* the
// alias-expanded accepted path: a command reachable through an alias enters
// compareEffectiveFlags once per accepted spelling, and keying on the accepted
// path would let every alias spelling bypass the exemption and re-report the
// change.
//
// This table is duplicated in scripts/policy/interface-baseline/reviewed.go and
// the two must stay identical; TestCrossPlatformCoverageReviewedFlagTypeTableMatchesInterfaceBaseline
// fails if they drift. The duplication is forced rather than chosen:
// check-authoritative-interface-baselines.sh copies the whole
// scripts/policy/interface-baseline directory into a worktree checked out at a
// historical revision and builds it there, so that copy cannot import a package
// this branch adds.

// reviewedFlagTypeChanges enumerates the individually reviewed flag type
// migrations this gate accepts. A flag type is part of the published CLI
// contract, and a type swap cannot be proven safe from the type names alone —
// whether old invocations still parse depends on the concrete value domain the
// command enforces. So a migration is accepted only when this exact command,
// flag, and old→new pair appear here. Adding an entry is a contract decision
// and belongs in review, not in a feature change.
//
// Entries are direction-sensitive by construction: "string" → "int" is a
// separate key from "int" → "string" and only the reviewed direction is
// accepted. An int → string migration is not automatically safe: it must keep
// accepting every historically successful numeric spelling and constrain any
// newly accepted strings in RunE.
//
// The table alone does not admit a change: reviewedFlagTypeChange is consulted
// only when nothing else about the flag moved. See compareEffectiveFlags.

	// with strconv.ParseInt(v, 10, 64) in RunE to a native Int flag, keeping the
	// same [2,4] domain check in RunE.
	//
	// This is admissible because the historical set of *successful* invocations
	// is a subset of the new one, not merely similar to it:
	//
	//   - Old: the value had to parse as base-10 and land in [2,4]. That is
	//     exactly "2", "3", "4" plus sign/leading-zero spellings of them
	//     ("+3", "03", "003", ...).
	//   - New: pflag's intValue.Set parses with strconv.ParseInt(s, 0, 64) —
	//     base 0 — and RunE still enforces [2,4]. Every base-10 spelling above
	//     resolves to the same number under base 0, so no historical success
	//     becomes a failure.
	//   - Base 0 additionally accepts "0x3" and friends, which the old parser
	//     rejected. That widens the accepted set; it cannot break a caller who
	//     was already succeeding.
	//   - Values outside [2,4] and non-numeric values still fail. Only the
	//     failure *message and timing* move, from RunE to flag parsing.
	//
	// The flag's default value changes from "" to "0" as an unavoidable
	// consequence of the type. Neither gate compares defaults, and a default is
	// not reachable by a caller here because RunE requires the flag to be
	// explicitly set, so this is not a contract change.

	// preserves every numeric spelling accepted by the historical pflag Int.

	// them to the corresponding enum names before transport.
