<h2 id="why-dws">Why dws?</h2>

- **For humans** — `--help` for usage, `--dry-run` to preview requests, `-f table/json/raw` for output formats.
- **For AI agents** — structured JSON responses + built-in Agent Skills, ready out of the box.
- **For enterprise admins** — zero-trust architecture: OAuth device-flow auth + domain allowlisting + least-privilege scoping. **Not a single byte can bypass authentication and audit.**

## Installation

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Skill mode: mono vs multi</strong></summary>

The installer ships skills in one of two layouts. CLI commands (`dws aitable ...`, `dws calendar ...`) are identical in both modes — only the agent-side skill layout differs.

| Mode | What gets installed | Best for |
|------|----------------------|----------|
| **multi** (default) | Per-product skills (`dingtalk-aitable`, `dingtalk-calendar`, `dingtalk-chat`, ...) | Single-product tasks; smaller context per call |
| **mono** (legacy) | One `dws` skill covering all products | Cross-product workflows; single entry point |

> Installs and upgrades default to `multi`. `mono` remains available via `DWS_SKILL_MODE=mono` or `dws skill setup --mode mono`. File issues if you hit problems.

How to pick:

- **Quick install** (one-liner above): non-interactive, installs `multi`.
- **TTY install** (download then run): `curl -O .../install.sh && bash install.sh` — prompts `1) multi  2) mono` (default 1).
- **Override via env**: `DWS_SKILL_MODE=mono curl -fsSL ... | sh`.
- **Switch later**: `dws skill setup --mode mono` (or `--mode multi`) — review the listed paths and confirm interactively.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other install methods</summary>

**npm** (requires Node.js (npm/npx)):

```bash
npm install -g dingtalk-workspace-cli
```

Install the latest beta:

```bash
npm install -g dingtalk-workspace-cli@beta
```

**Homebrew** (macOS / Linux):

```bash
brew tap DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli.git
brew install dingtalk-workspace-cli
```

> The Formula lives in this repository, so the first `tap` command must include the explicit repository URL. Afterwards, use `brew upgrade dingtalk-workspace-cli` normally.

Install the keg-only Homebrew beta without replacing the stable Formula:

```bash
brew install dingtalk-workspace-cli-beta
$(brew --prefix dingtalk-workspace-cli-beta)/bin/dws version
```

To make the beta `dws` the default for the current shell, prepend `$(brew --prefix dingtalk-workspace-cli-beta)/bin` to PATH.

**Pre-built binary**: download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/releases).

> **macOS users**: If you see "cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software", run:
> ```bash
> xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/dws
> ```

**Build from source**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli.git
cd dingtalk-workspace-cli
go build -o dws ./cmd       # build to current directory
cp dws ~/.local/bin/         # install to PATH
```

Static endpoint data is generated from the Wukong baseline and committed in this
repository under `internal/syncdata`, so source builds do not require a sibling
data checkout.

> Requires Go 1.25+. Use `make package` to cross-compile for all platforms (macOS / Linux / Windows x amd64 / arm64).

</details>

## China mirror

For users in mainland China, the following channels avoid GitHub network issues. By default (without setting these environment variables) the installer pulls from GitHub.

**1. Install script + pre-built binary (Gitee mirror):**

Repository mirror: `https://gitee.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli`

```bash
DWS_GITEE_REPO=DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli curl -fsSL https://gitee.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/raw/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

> With `DWS_GITEE_REPO` set, the installer resolves the latest version and every release asset (binary, checksums, skills) from the Gitee API instead of GitHub. If it is unset, installation defaults to GitHub.

**2. npm package (npmmirror mirror):**

```bash
npm install -g dingtalk-workspace-cli --registry=https://registry.npmmirror.com
```

> npmmirror automatically syncs public packages from the public npm registry, so this works directly in China.

**3. Skills only (Gitee mirror):**

```bash
DWS_GITEE_REPO=DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli curl -fsSL https://gitee.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/raw/main/scripts/install-skills.sh | sh
```

> With `DWS_GITEE_REPO` set, `install-skills.sh` resolves the version and skills package from Gitee; it also auto-falls back to the Gitee mirror when GitHub is unreachable.

## Upgrade

> Requires **v1.0.7** or later. For earlier versions, please re-run the [install script](#installation) to upgrade.

dws has built-in self-upgrade capability. Updates are pulled directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/releases) with SHA256 integrity verification and automatic backup.

```bash
dws upgrade                    # interactive upgrade to latest version
dws upgrade --check            # check for new versions without installing
dws upgrade --list             # list stable release versions
dws upgrade --beta             # upgrade to the latest beta pre-release
dws upgrade --check --beta     # check the beta track without installing
dws upgrade --list --beta      # list beta pre-release versions
dws upgrade --version v1.0.7   # upgrade to a specific version
dws upgrade --version v1.0.8-beta.1  # upgrade to a specific beta version
dws upgrade --rollback         # rollback to the previous version
dws upgrade -y                 # skip confirmation prompt
```

By default, `dws upgrade` follows the stable release track. Use `--beta` only when you explicitly want the newest GitHub pre-release build.

### Six-channel post-release verification

Maintainers and release validators can run the release-quality smoke checks for curl, PowerShell, npm stable, npm beta, Homebrew, and `dws upgrade`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli.git /tmp/dws-verify
cd /tmp/dws-verify/verify
bash verify-all-channels.sh
```

The verifier uses isolated directories and does not replace the `dws` on the current PATH. It reports `PASS`, `FAIL`, and `SKIP`; a platform skip is not a pass and must be covered on the matching host. See [`verify/README.md`](verify/README.md) for the platform matrix.

<details>
<summary><strong>How it works</strong></summary>

The upgrade process follows a two-phase atomic flow to ensure consistency:

1. **Prepare** — downloads the platform-specific binary and skill packages to a temporary directory, verifies SHA256 checksums, and extracts/validates all files. If any step fails, the upgrade aborts without modifying the existing installation.
2. **Apply** — only after all preparations succeed, the binary is replaced and skills are flattened into the canonical `~/.agents/skills` root. Agents classified by the pinned compatibility registry as supporting the universal root read it directly; other detected Agents receive links to the canonical copy, with a direct-copy fallback when links are unavailable. Older DWS-managed agent-specific copies are backed up and retired so the same Skill is not discovered twice.

A backup of the current version is automatically created before each upgrade. Use `dws upgrade --rollback` to restore the previous version if needed.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--check` | Check for updates without installing |
| `--list` | List available stable release versions with changelogs |
| `--beta` | Use the beta pre-release track for `upgrade`, `--check`, or `--list` |
| `--version` | Upgrade to a specific version (e.g. `v1.0.7` or `v1.0.8-beta.1`) |
| `--rollback` | Rollback to the previous backed-up version |
| `--force` | Force reinstall even if already on the latest version |
| `--skip-skills` | Skip skill package update |
| `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt |

</details>

## Getting Started

```bash
dws auth login            # browser opens automatically
dws auth login --device   # for headless environments (Docker, SSH, CI)
```

Select your organization and authorize. That's it.

> If your organization hasn't enabled CLI access, you'll be prompted to send an access request to your admin. Once approved, re-run `dws auth login`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Organization hasn't enabled CLI access?</strong></summary>

1. After selecting your organization, click "Apply Now" to notify the admin
2. The admin receives a request card and can approve with one click
3. Once approved, re-run `dws auth login`

<details>
<summary><strong>Custom App mode (CI/CD, ISV integration)</strong></summary>

For enterprise-managed scenarios, create your own DingTalk app:

1. [Open Platform Console](https://open-dev.dingtalk.com/fe/app#/corp/app) → Create App
2. Security Settings → Add redirect URLs: `http://127.0.0.1,https://login.dingtalk.com`
3. Publish the app
4. Login:

```bash
dws auth login --client-id <your-app-key> --client-secret <your-app-secret>
```

Credentials are securely persisted after first login (Keychain). Subsequent runs auto-refresh tokens.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Multiple organizations (profiles)</strong></summary>

`dws` can stay logged in to several DingTalk accounts at once, including multiple accounts in the same organization. A profile is uniquely identified by `corpId:userId`; the current profile decides which identity a command runs as.

```bash
dws auth login                              # add or refresh one account
dws profile list                            # list every logged-in account
dws profile switch <corpId:userId>          # persistently switch; use - to toggle back
dws profile switch "<corpName>:<userName>"  # friendly input; names must be unique
dws --profile <corpId> contact user search --query "..."        # use that org's explicitly recorded current account
dws --profile <corpId:userId> contact user search --query "..." # use one exact account without changing the default
```

Selectors support `corpId:userId`, `corpId:userName`, `corpName:userId`, and `corpName:userName`. Friendly names are input aliases only; use the stable `profile` value returned by `profile list` for automation. Duplicate organization or account names fail with explicit `corpId:userId` candidates. If an organization has multiple accounts but no recorded current account, `--profile <corpId>` fails instead of choosing the first or most recently used account.

`currentProfile`, `previousProfile`, and per-organization defaults are stored as exact identities. `primaryProfile` remains in JSON only for compatibility and is not used for selection. `profile list` reads status and expiry from each real identity Token without refreshing it. `auth logout --profile <corpId>` removes all local accounts in that organization; an exact selector or local profile name removes one account.

Cross-org reads are orchestrated by the agent rather than a built-in `--all-orgs`: list profiles, group by `corpId`, and use the unique `isOrgCurrent=true` account for each organization. If a multi-account organization has no default, ask the user to choose an account first. Writes default to the current account — confirm both organization and account before cross-org writes.

On macOS, an unreadable registered token slot blocks a new OAuth login rather than risking a mixed Keychain/file-DEK state. If normal terminal commands can still read the login while a sandbox using `DWS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN=1` cannot, migrate the legacy and profile auth entries without exposing tokens:

```bash
env -u DWS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN dws auth migrate-keychain --to file-dek --dry-run --format json
env -u DWS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN dws auth migrate-keychain --to file-dek --yes --format json
DWS_DISABLE_KEYCHAIN=1 dws auth status --format json
```

The migration validates every selected auth ciphertext before writing, ignores unrelated application secrets, and can be rerun after an interrupted commit. If validation identifies genuinely damaged ciphertext, remove only the affected account with `dws auth logout --profile <corpId:userId>`, or all accounts in one organization with `--profile <corpId>`, then log in again. Use `dws auth reset` only when you intend to discard every local profile.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Migrate auth between Linux sandboxes</strong></summary>

Copying only `~/.dws/app.json` does not carry the refresh token; access tokens expire after ~2 hours. Use the official export/import flow:

```bash
# Sandbox A (already logged in)
dws auth export -o /tmp/dws-auth.tar.gz
# Or for copy/paste: dws auth export --base64 -o /tmp/dws-auth.b64

# Sandbox B
dws auth import -i /tmp/dws-auth.tar.gz
# Or: dws auth import -i /tmp/dws-auth.b64 --base64
dws auth status   # confirm "Refresh Token: valid"
```

The bundle includes the encrypted keychain under `~/.local/share/dws-cli` (with `auth-token.enc` and `dek`) plus required `~/.dws` config files.
Windows export and import are intentionally rejected before credentials or
bundles are read: Windows stores credentials as DPAPI-protected HKCU Registry
values, and the current file-DEK bundle has no safe DPAPI-to-portable conversion.

## Quick Start

```bash
dws contact user search --query "engineering"      # search contacts
dws calendar event list                            # list today's calendar events
dws doc search --query "quarterly"                 # search DingTalk Docs
dws minutes list mine                              # list AI meeting notes I created
dws drive list                                     # list DingTalk drive files
dws todo task create --title "Quarterly report" --executors "<your-userId>"   # create a todo (replace <your-userId>)
dws todo task list --dry-run                       # preview without executing
```

## Using with Agents

dws is designed as an AI-native CLI. Complete [Installation](#installation) and [Getting Started](#getting-started) first, then configure your agent:

### Agent Invocation Patterns

```bash
# Use --yes to skip confirmation prompts (required for agents)
dws todo task create --title "Review PR" --executors "<your-userId>" --yes

# Use --dry-run to preview operations (safe execution)
dws contact user search --query "engineering" --dry-run

# Use --jq to extract precisely (save tokens)
dws contact user get-self --jq '.result[0].orgEmployeeModel | {name: .orgUserName, dept: .depts[0].deptName, userId}'
```

### Command Help and Schema

Use Cobra help and Schema for different parts of the command contract:

- `dws <path> --help` is the source of truth for whether a command exists and which flags the binary accepts.
- `dws schema "<path>" --compact` is the normative Agent view for command selection, CLI parameters and constraints, risk, and confirmation; use a full leaf with a narrow `--jq` projection for mapping or provenance audits.
- If Help and Schema disagree, treat it as contract drift: pass only flags accepted by Cobra and use the more conservative safety semantics.
- Schema describes commands; it does not read or search DingTalk business data. Execute the real product command after discovery.

```bash
# Confirm that the command exists and inspect accepted flags
dws aitable record query --help

# Discover within a product, then inspect the selected leaf contract
dws schema aitable --compact
dws schema "aitable record query" --compact

# Execute the real business query
dws aitable record query --base-id BASE_ID --table-id TABLE_ID --limit 10
```

`dws schema --all` exports the complete contract for tooling, CI, audits, and compatibility baselines. Agents should query progressively with `--compact`; its positive field allowlist prevents new full/audit fields from silently expanding Agent context.

### Agent Skills

The repo ships a complete Agent Skill system under `skills/`, organized into two layouts:

- `skills/mono/` — single-skill layout (one `SKILL.md` + `references/products/`), legacy.
- `skills/multi/` — per-product skills (`dingtalk-aitable/`, `dingtalk-calendar/`, `dingtalk-chat/`, ...), each with its own `SKILL.md`. Default layout.

Leaf safety/parameters/selection prose for Schema generation come from ProductDecl / ContractFinal declarations in Go. The former `internal/cli/schema_hints/` HintFile tree is fully retired and must not reappear.

After installing, AI tools like Claude Code / Cursor can operate DingTalk directly through natural language:

```bash
# Install skills into current project (defaults to multi; DWS_SKILL_MODE=mono switches back)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/main/scripts/install-skills.sh | sh
```

> Installers use `$HOME/.agents/skills/` as the canonical global store, following the universal `.agents/skills` convention. Agents classified by the pinned compatibility registry as universal read that root directly; detected non-universal Agents receive links to it (or copies when links are unavailable). Multi layout is per-product siblings, while mono uses the `dws/` subdirectory.
>
> China users: prefix `DWS_GITEE_REPO` to use the Gitee mirror — see [China mirror](#china-mirror).

**Switching or re-installing with `dws skill setup`:**

```bash
# Interactive: prompts for mode + target agents
dws skill setup

# Preview the exact directories that mono setup would back up and replace
dws skill setup --mode mono --target all --dry-run

# Run interactively and confirm the listed directories
dws skill setup --mode mono --target all

# Preview, then install multi skills to a single agent home with interactive confirmation
dws skill setup --mode multi --target cursor --dry-run
dws skill setup --mode multi --target cursor

# Point at a local source (an extracted dws-skills.zip root, its multi/ directory, or a source checkout), preview first
DWS_SKILL_SOURCE=/absolute/path/to/extracted-dws-skills dws skill setup --mode multi --dry-run
DWS_SKILL_SOURCE=/absolute/path/to/extracted-dws-skills dws skill setup --mode multi
```

| Flag | Values | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `--mode` | `mono` \| `multi` | Skill layout; defaults to interactive prompt |
| `--target` | `all` \| `claude` \| `cursor` \| `codex` \| `zcode` \| `opencode` \| `qoder` | Where to install; `all` covers every detected agent home, including ZCode at `~/.zcode/skills` |
| `--source` | path | Local source directory (overrides bundled skills); accepts a mode directory, an extracted `dws-skills.zip` root, or a source checkout containing `skills/` |
| `--yes` | — | Scripting-only: skip the confirmation prompt. Removals are still backed up to `~/.dws/skill-backups/` first |

> The setup command can remove the opposite-mode layout (`dws/` for multi, DWS-managed multi Skills for mono) and stale managed Skills not in the bundle. DWS records ownership, installer version, source, and content digest centrally in `~/.dws/skills-state.json` (or `$DWS_CONFIG_DIR/skills-state.json`). Exact official names shipped before the centralized state remain a frozen migration list. A `dingtalk-*` prefix alone never authorizes cleanup, so other same-prefix market/user Skills are preserved. Every removal is previewed before confirmation and preserved under `~/.dws/skill-backups/<timestamp>/`; a directory that cannot be backed up is never removed. In a non-interactive shell, first run `--dry-run` and inspect its output; only then may the caller explicitly choose the scripting-only confirmation bypass.

After a multi setup or upgrade, DWS stores the official bundle snapshot and centralized ownership metadata in `~/.dws/skills-state.json` (or `$DWS_CONFIG_DIR/skills-state.json`). Every upgrade installs and overwrites the complete bundled Skill set from that release. Deleting or excluding a bundled Skill is not sticky: the next upgrade restores it. `dws upgrade --force` additionally allows reinstalling the current CLI version when no newer version is available.

Env vars: `DWS_SKILL_MODE=mono|multi` (also honored by `install.sh` / `install.ps1`), `DWS_SKILL_SOURCE=<path>`.

**What's included (mono layout):**

| Component | Path | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Master Skill | `skills/mono/SKILL.md` | Intent routing, decision tree, safety rules, error handling |
| Product references | `skills/mono/references/products/*.md` | Per-product command reference (aitable, chat, calendar, etc.) |

## Features

<details>
<summary><strong>Personal Event Subscription</strong> — real-time DingTalk messages for event-driven agents</summary>

`dws event consume` subscribes as the currently logged-in user over a managed Stream WebSocket and emits each event as one NDJSON line on stdout. The public catalog covers scoped and all one-to-one/group messages, specified senders, read/recall/reaction events, group lifecycle events, seven OA approval task/instance events, and three Todo task lifecycle events.

The default `ndjson`, `json`, and `pretty` output preserves the transport envelope (`type`, `event_type`, string `data`, and `headers`) for existing scripts; `compact` retains its existing processor. Add `--flatten` to emit the stable top-level business fields used by Agent workflows. `--format` controls JSON serialization; `--flatten` controls the data structure and cannot be combined with `-f raw` or `--debug-raw-events`.

> **Prerequisite**: run `dws auth login`. Personal identity is resolved from the OAuth token and cannot be supplied through command-line identity flags.

For an event-focused installation, use the official convenience installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/main/scripts/install-event.sh | sh

# Or install the standalone multi skill from an existing dws installation
dws skill setup --mode multi -s event
```

```bash
# Inspect the public personal event catalog and schema
dws event list
dws event schema user_im_message_receive_o2o --flatten
dws event list --category oa
dws event schema user_oa_approval_task_created --flatten
dws event list --category todo
dws event schema user_todo_task_create --flatten

# Listen for messages that mention the current user
dws event +listen-im --kind at-me -f ndjson

# Listen for messages from a specified sender

# Listen by openDingtalkId (external contact, bot, or cross-organization identity)
dws event +listen-im --kind sender --open-dingtalk-id <openDingtalkId> -f ndjson

# Listen for messages in a specified group
dws event +listen-im --kind group --chat-id <openConversationId> -f ndjson

For one-to-one and specified-sender events, use exactly one target identity: `--user` for an internal `userId`, or `--open-dingtalk-id` for an `openDingtalkId`. The CLI does not infer or convert between these identity types.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Managed lifecycle | `consume` creates or reuses the personal subscription; `stop` cancels it and cleans local state |
| Shared connection | Consumers for the same user share one local bus and cloud connection |
| Multi-event process | One consume process can listen for compatible events for the same target while retaining one subscription per event |
| Subscription isolation | Normal consumers match both event type and `subscribe_id` |
| Agent-friendly output | Stream events are written to stdout as NDJSON; status and diagnostics use stderr |
| Observability | `status` shows remote subscriptions, the personal bus, and local consumers |
| Cross-platform | Unix Socket on macOS/Linux, Windows Named Pipe on Windows |

<summary><strong>Raw API Access</strong> — call App Token-capable server-side DingTalk OpenAPIs directly</summary>

`dws api` lets you call server-side DingTalk OpenAPIs that support an internal-app App Token, without an SDK. Tokens are automatically acquired and refreshed.

> **Prerequisite**: Provide one complete custom-app Client ID/Client Secret pair through one-shot flags, environment variables, or app config saved by a successful login (see [Custom App mode](#getting-started)). MCP default-credential login alone does not support Raw API calls.

Client ID and Client Secret are resolved only as one complete pair, in this order: complete `--client-id/--client-secret` > complete `DWS_CLIENT_ID/DWS_CLIENT_SECRET` > complete app config. A half-configured source fails explicitly and is never combined with another source. Flags/env used directly by `dws api` are one-shot and do not persist the App Secret; flags/env used by a successful `dws auth login` are persisted as that exact pair for OAuth refresh and later Raw API calls. The acquired App Token is cached under `app-token:<clientID>`; the hidden `--token` accepts a temporary caller-supplied App Token and neither persists nor refreshes it.

Client Secrets use the canonical Keychain slot `appsecret:<clientID>`, distinct from OAuth User Tokens and App Tokens. Existing plaintext app config and historical `client-secret:<clientID>` entries are migrated automatically. If the old and new slots disagree, DWS fails closed and asks for a new login instead of guessing.

```bash
# Login (first time only)
dws auth login --client-id <APP_KEY> --client-secret <APP_SECRET>

# Or use one environment pair; a complete env pair overrides app config atomically
export DWS_CLIENT_ID=<APP_KEY>
export DWS_CLIENT_SECRET=<APP_SECRET>

# === api.dingtalk.com ===

# List all enterprise apps
dws api GET /v1.0/microApp/allApps

# Search users (POST + JSON body)
dws api POST /v1.0/contact/users/search \
  --data '{"queryWord":"engineering","offset":0,"size":10}'

# === oapi.dingtalk.com ===

# Get user details (use --base-url to specify domain)
dws api POST /topapi/v2/user/get \
  --base-url https://oapi.dingtalk.com \
  --data '{"userid":"<USER_ID>"}'

# Or use the full URL directly
dws api POST https://oapi.dingtalk.com/topapi/v2/user/get \
  --data '{"userid":"<USER_ID>"}'

# === General ===
dws api GET /v1.0/microApp/allApps --dry-run             # preview request
dws api GET /v1.0/microApp/allApps --jq '.appList | length'  # jq filtering

# Read a JSON body from a file (--params also accepts @file; use - for stdin)
dws api POST https://oapi.dingtalk.com/topapi/v2/department/listsubid \
  --data @department-request.json --dry-run

# Stream one multipart file; top-level --data fields become text form fields; review a dry-run first
dws api POST https://oapi.dingtalk.com/media/upload \
  --data '{"type":"image"}' --file media=./demo.png --dry-run
```

| Feature | Details |
|---------|----------|
| Dual-form auto-detection | Automatically selects api.dingtalk.com (header auth) or oapi.dingtalk.com (query-param auth) based on URL |
| Automatic token management | App-level accessToken is fetched on first call, cached while valid, auto-refreshed on expiry |
| Domain allowlist | Only `api.dingtalk.com` and `oapi.dingtalk.com` permitted — prevents token leakage |
| Auto-pagination | `--page-all` iterates all pages. `--page-limit` caps the maximum (default 10, set to 0 for unlimited, hard cap at 500 to prevent infinite loops) |
| Secure transport | HTTPS/443 and same-origin HTTPS redirects only; bounded JSON/error reads and streamed atomic binary downloads |
| Agent discovery | When product commands do not cover an API, the bundled misc/mono Skill follows `https://open.dingtalk.com/llms.txt` to the official endpoint docs; raw `api` remains excluded from Agent Schema |

`dws api` automatically uses only an internal-app App Token. It does not read OAuth User Tokens and does not expose `--as user` / `--user`. Prefer an existing DWS product command; use this escape hatch only for an uncovered internal-app server OpenAPI. Review a dry-run and confirm before create, update, delete, revoke, or send operations.

<summary><strong>Smart Input Correction</strong> — auto-corrects common AI model parameter mistakes</summary>

Built-in pipeline engine that normalizes flag names, splits sticky arguments, and fuzzy-matches typos:

```bash
# Naming convention auto-conversion (camelCase / snake_case / UPPER -> kebab-case)
dws aitable record query --baseId BASE_ID --tableId TABLE_ID         # auto-corrected to --base-id --table-id

# Sticky argument splitting
dws contact user search --query "engineering" --timeout30           # auto-split to --timeout 30

# Fuzzy flag name matching
dws aitable record query --base-id BASE_ID --tabel-id TABLE_ID       # --tabel-id -> --table-id

# Value normalization (boolean / number / date / enum)
# "yes" -> true, "1,000" -> 1000, "2024/03/29" -> "2024-03-29", "ACTIVE" -> "active"
```

| Agent Output | dws Auto-Corrects To |
|-----------|--------------|
| `--userId` | `--user-id` |
| `--limit100` | `--limit 100` |
| `--tabel-id` | `--table-id` |

> **Note**: `@` is treated as the `@<path>` file-injection prefix only when the next character is an ASCII path-shaped character (`A-Z` / `a-z` / `0-9` / `.` / `/` / `~` / `_` / `-`), or `@-` for stdin. Chat-bot payloads like `--text "@所有人 周报"` or `--text "@张三 看一下"` pass through unchanged, so literal mentions reach the API as-is.

## DingTalk bot — connect a robot to your local AI

`dws dev connect` bridges a DingTalk robot to a local AI CLI (Claude Code / Codex / opencode / Qoder / Gemini, or any tool via `--agent-cmd`): @-mention the bot in a chat and it answers using your local agent, keeping per-conversation multi-turn memory.

```bash
dws dev connect --channel auto --unified-app-id <unifiedAppId>
```

> `--unified-app-id` resolves `clientSecret` at runtime via `dev app credentials get`,
> so the secret never appears in argv (`ps` / journald / shell history). The
> legacy `--robot-client-id <id> --robot-client-secret <secret>` still works but
> the CLI will warn you.

In-chat **session commands** (send the bare command as the whole message — no agent turn, no tokens):

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `/new` (aliases `/start`, `/reset`) | Start a fresh session; the previous one is left intact (resumable where the agent supports it) |
| `/clear` | Wipe the current session — disposed through the agent's real session op (opencode issues `DELETE /session/:id`); channels whose agent exposes no delete primitive fall back to a reset |

See [`docs/robot-quickstart.md`](./docs/robot-quickstart.md) for the full 4-step walkthrough (install → create robot → connect → add to a group).

> Full command listing with usage scenarios: [`docs/command-index.md`](./docs/command-index.md). Run `dws --help` for the top-level tree, or `dws <service> --help` for any service's subcommands.

> **Note on `chat bot`**: bot capabilities (`send-by-bot` / `recall-by-bot` / `add-bot` / `send-by-webhook` / bot search) are merged into the relevant `chat` subtrees (e.g. `dws chat message send-by-bot`, `dws chat group members add-bot`) so the agent-facing command surface stays flat and discoverable. There is no longer a separate top-level `bot` product.

<summary>Coming soon</summary>

<h2 id="security-by-design">Security by Design</h2>

`dws` treats security as a first-class architectural concern, not an afterthought. **Credentials never touch disk, tokens never leave trusted domains, permissions never exceed grants, operations never escape audit** — every API call must pass through DingTalk Open Platform's authentication and audit chain, no exceptions.

<details>
<summary><strong>For Developers</strong></summary>

| Mechanism | Details |
|-----------|----------|
| **Encrypted token storage** | **PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM** encryption, keyed by device physical MAC address; cross-platform Keychain/DPAPI integration provides additional protection — tokens cannot be decrypted on another machine |
| **Input security** | Path traversal protection (symlink resolution + working directory containment), CRLF injection blocking, Unicode visual spoofing filtering — prevents AI Agents from being tricked by malicious instructions |
| **Domain allowlist** | `DWS_TRUSTED_DOMAINS` defaults to `*.dingtalk.com`; bearer tokens are never sent to non-allowlisted domains |
| **HTTPS enforced** | All requests require TLS; HTTP only permitted for loopback during development |
| **Dry-run preview** | `--dry-run` shows call parameters without executing, preventing accidental mutations |
| **Zero credential persistence** | Client ID / Secret used in memory only — never written to config files or logs |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>For Enterprise Admins</strong></summary>

| Mechanism | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **OAuth device-flow auth** | Users must authenticate through an admin-authorized DingTalk application |
| **Least-privilege scoping** | CLI can only invoke APIs granted to the application — no privilege escalation |
| **Allowlist gating** | Admin confirmation required during co-creation phase; self-service approval planned |
| **Full-chain audit** | Every data read/write passes through the DingTalk Open Platform API — enterprise admins can trace complete call logs in real time; no anomalous operation can hide |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>For ISVs</strong></summary>

| Mechanism | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Tenant data isolation** | Operates under authorized app identity; cross-tenant access is impossible |
| **Skill sandbox** | Agent Skills are Markdown documents (`SKILL.md`) — prompt descriptions only, no arbitrary code execution |
| **Zero blind spots** | Every API call during ISV–dws skill orchestration is forced through DingTalk Open Platform authentication — full call chain is traceable with no bypass path |
